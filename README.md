# Bottle-Bottle-Cap-Detection-System
The Bottle & Bottle Cap Detection System utilizes YOLOv8 for advanced real-time object detection, specifically targeting bottles and bottle caps. Leveraging a meticulously labeled dataset of 400 images with Roboflow, this project offers efficient and accurate detection capabilities. The system supports live webcam analysis, batch image processing, and single image detection, all facilitated through a user-friendly Tkinter GUI.

Key Features
Live Detection: Stream and analyze video from your webcam in real-time to identify bottles and bottle caps.
Batch Processing: Process and analyze multiple images from a selected directory, making it easy to handle large volumes of data.
Single Image Detection: Load and analyze individual images to detect objects with precision.
User-Friendly GUI: The Tkinter-based graphical user interface provides an intuitive and seamless experience for interaction with the detection system.
